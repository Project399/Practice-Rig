# Practice-Rig
Practice Rig for all to crash, the goal of the practice rig is a dead simple platform, where new comers to the FPV world can have a frame to practice with and not have to worry about breaking too many parts in the process. Its also for the experts, slowing down the drone allows for better training of line work and throttle control.

# Reccomended Build
2408/2507/2510 sized motors, in 1300kv: The reason for the lower KV is to force you to learn race lines. If you're always using extra power as a crutch to fly, you wont ever learn the fast way around the track. Having a slower heavier quad forces you to keep your momentum and practice good race lines. 

5s 2200mah or 2x 1300mah packs in parallel: The larger battery helps you get as much flight time as possible. You can now full throttle for 5 minutes straight. Squeezing the most practice time out of your time at the field.

7" props: Helps get those longer flight times, also thats what we race on DRL with the R4. HQ 7x4x3 are currently the only prop that is reccomended for this build

Hobbywing G3 ESC+FC Stack: This rig is suppose to be SUPER SOLID. This stack can take a beating and keep on ripping. Otherwise any stack will work just fine.
